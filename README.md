DTM Software Engineering devOps project
The following project is aims to demonstrate the students' understanding about 
software engineering/DevOps principle. It was build by Leonardo Ghiani and Mohamed Alie Kamara


## IDEA
The main idea is apply simple DevOps principle in the field of Data Science. Here we assume the role 
of a WebDeveloper/full-stack-engineer working with a team of Data Scientist/Analyst or Business Intelligence 
experts in a company and his role is to automate and publish the findings internally/ within a company or 
externally with other stackholders. As for this project we decided to use the free Covid health-data from 
the [WHO official website](https://covid19.who.int/) , and Tableau software for simple analysis and visualization. 
The section uses live update data from [our world in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) an official website trusted 
by top research institution around the world such as Havard and Oxford.
